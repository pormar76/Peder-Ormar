    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some of the things I enjoy the most in my free time. My interests
      are a mix of gaming, sports, music, movies, and podcasts — all things that
      have shaped a lot of who I am today.

  <!-- GAMING -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Gaming has always been a big part of my life. I play a lot of
        <strong>EAFC (formerly FIFA)</strong>, since I enjoy football both on and off the pitch.
        I also like playing <strong>Star Wars Battlefront II</strong>, especially its multiplayer
        modes, and I sometimes play <strong>Fortnite</strong> with the boys when we want to chill
        and have fun.

  <!-- SPORTS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Football</h3>
        <p>
          Football is my biggest passion. I support <strong>Liverpool</strong> and my hometown
          club <strong>Sandefjord</strong>. Whether it's Premier League, Champions League or
          Eliteserien, I love watching matches and following the drama of the season.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Formula 1</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy watching Formula 1 as well. I don’t really support one team
          specifically, but I like <strong>Red Bull</strong> and <strong>Max Verstappen</strong>.
          The rivalry, strategy and speed make the sport exciting to follow.
        </p>

  <!-- MUSIC -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I listen to a mix of artists, but my favorites right now are
        <strong>RocBoyz</strong>, <strong>GOLF</strong> and <strong>The Kid Laroi</strong>.
        Music is something I use for everything: training, gaming, traveling or just chilling.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- PODCASTS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Podcasts</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I also listen to a lot of sports-related podcasts. My two favorites are
        <strong>B-Laget</strong> and <strong>Spårtsklubben</strong>. They are funny, entertaining,
        and a great way to stay updated on what happens in the world of sports.
      </p>
    </div>

  <!-- MOVIES & SERIES -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Movies & TV Shows</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Movies</h3>
        <p>
          I am a huge <strong>Star Wars</strong> fan, and my favorite movie is
          <em>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</em>. I also enjoy the
          <strong>James Bond</strong> films — my favorite is <em>Goldfinger (1964)</em>,
          which I think is one of the best Bond movies ever made.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>TV Shows</h3>
        <p>
          My favorite shows are <strong>How I Met Your Mother</strong>,
          <strong>The Office</strong> and <strong>The Boys</strong>.
          They all have different vibes, but I enjoy them for their humor, characters and stories.
