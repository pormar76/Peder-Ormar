    <h2>My interests</h2>
    <p>
      My interests are strongly connected to sports, media and storytelling. Football has
      been a big part of my life since I was a kid, and today my goal is to combine that
      passion with journalism and sports commentary.

  <!-- FOOTBALL JOURNEY -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Football and my playing career</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          I started playing football when I was six years old, and from then until I was
          nineteen I played for <strong>Store Bergan IL</strong> in Sandefjord. The club
          became a big part of my everyday life, with training, matches and time spent
          with teammates on and off the pitch.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021 I was named <strong>Player of the Year</strong> at Store Bergan IL.
          That meant a lot to me, because it reflected not only performances on the field,
          but also effort, attitude and commitment to the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I eventually stopped playing for the club when I was 19 due to military service,
          but football is still a huge part of my life and something I follow closely.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          After spending a year at the Norway–Russia border during my military service,
          I moved back to Sandefjord. There I continued playing football while working
          at an elementary school to make money and gain experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Football has given me discipline, teamwork, and the ability to handle both wins
          and losses. Those are skills that also transfer well into journalism and media.
        </p>

  <!-- FROM SANDEFJORD TO THE US -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>From Sandefjord to the US</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        After working for a while, I decided it was time to study. Since I have always
        wanted to work with sports commentary, I chose a bachelor in journalism and
        started studying in Norway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, I got the chance to study in the United States. That is how I ended up
        here at UWRF, working on projects like this website, the <em>Gift &amp; Thrift</em>
        event and different journalism assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studying abroad has given me a new perspective on media, language and culture,
        and it has confirmed that I want to continue working with sports and storytelling
        in some form.
      </p>

  <!-- SPORTS COMMENTARY -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Sports commentary and media</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        One of my biggest interests is <strong>sports commentary</strong>. When I watch
        football or other sports, I do not only follow the game – I also listen closely
        to how the commentators work. I pay attention to their energy, language, timing
        and how they build excitement.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like analyzing matches, following different leagues and sometimes doing my own
        “test commentary” while watching games. This helps me understand what works well,
        and it brings me a bit closer to my long-term goal of working in sports media.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiences like helping to cover the Ski World Championships and working with
        events such as UWRF Gift &amp; Thrift have also given me insight into how
        communication and media work behind the scenes.

  <!-- GAMING, PODCASTS AND MUSIC -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Gaming, podcasts and music</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
          In my free time I enjoy gaming, especially <strong>EAFC</strong> and
          <strong>Star Wars Battlefront II</strong>. I also sometimes play
          <strong>Fortnite</strong> with friends. Gaming is a way for me to relax,
          compete and stay connected with people back home.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Podcasts</h3>
        <p>
          I often listen to sports podcasts such as <strong>B-Laget</strong> and
          <strong>Spårtsklubben</strong>. They are funny, entertaining and a great way
          to stay updated on what happens in the world of sports, while also getting
          inspiration from how people talk about games and players.
        </p>
        <div style="display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:16px; margin-top:10px;">

      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
          When it comes to music, I mostly listen to <strong>pop</strong>,
          <strong>rap</strong> and <strong>Norwegian music</strong>. It is what I use
          when I travel, train, game or just need to clear my head. Music is a good way
          to change or boost my mood.

  <!-- OTHER SPORTS I FOLLOW -->

    <h2>Other sports I follow and enjoy</h2>

    <div class="card-grid">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Golf</h3>
        <p>
          I also enjoy playing golf whenever I get the chance. It’s a sport that requires
          focus, patience and a calm mindset, which makes it very different from football.
          I like the challenge of improving small parts of my game and the social aspect
          of playing with friends.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Formula 1</h3>
        <p>
          I follow Formula 1 as well. Even though I don’t support one specific team, I
          enjoy watching <strong>Red Bull</strong> and <strong>Max Verstappen</strong>.
          What I like most about F1 is the mix of strategy, speed and the personalities
          both on and off the track. It’s a sport where every second matters, and that
          makes it exciting to follow.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Skiing</h3>
        <p>
          Growing up in Norway, skiing has always been a part of life. I’m not a
          professional by any means, but I love going out on the slopes or doing a
          cross-country session when I can. Skiing is one of the best ways to enjoy
          winter, stay active, and spend time with friends.
