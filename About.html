    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I come from a little town in Norway called SANDEFJORD. Born and raised in the "Whale City". From age 6 up until I was 19 years old i played for one of the soccer teams in the city, Store Bergan IL.
      I stopped playing for them when I was 19, due to millitary service. After one year at the Norway/Russia border, I moved back to Sandefjord and played soccer while working in an elementary school to make money.
      After 6 months of working, I decided it was time to study. Since I always have wanted to be a sports commentator, I figured a bachelor in journalism would be the thing for me. And after one year in Norway I am here now in the US, making this website as a assignment. Weird how thing work out. huh?
