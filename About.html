    <!-- INTRO PARAGRAPHS -->
    <p>
      My name is Peder Ormar, and this website is about me! Here you can get to know
      me a bit better. I am a student who has a dream to become a soccer commentator,
      and make a living from watching sports.
    </p>

    <p>
      I come from a little town in Norway called Sandefjord — born and raised in the
      “Whale City”. From age 6 up until I was 19 years old I played for one of the
      soccer teams in the city, Store Bergan IL.
    </p>

    <p>
      I stopped playing for them when I was 19, because of military service. After
      one year at the Norway–Russia border, I moved back to Sandefjord and played
      soccer while working at an elementary school to make money.
    </p>

    <p>
      After 6 months of working, I decided it was time to study. Since I always
      wanted to be a sports commentator, I figured a bachelor in journalism would be
      the right choice for me. And after one year in Norway I am now here in the US,
      making this website as an assignment. Weird how things work out, huh?

    <h2>My proudest moment in journalism</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        One of the highlights of my early journalism journey was interviewing
        <strong>Petter Northug</strong> during the Ski World Championships in Trondheim.
        As someone who dreams of working in sports media and football commentary, this
        moment showed me that I’m on the right path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being on site, preparing questions and then standing in front of the camera
        with one of Norway’s biggest sports profiles was both nerve-racking and
        motivating. It gave me a taste of what I want to do more of in the future.
